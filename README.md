# Mrubiks

A small collection of MATLAB functions for plotting Rubik's cubes. 
They're a little dirty, but they work. 
There is an associated Latex document describing the last layer using [CFOP](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/CFOP). 
The code is in the `rubiks` package under the `Figures` directory. 
Document PDF is in [releases](https://github.com/raacampbell/mrubicks/releases).
